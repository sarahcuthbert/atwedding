`pnpm test`

### Running server locally

There is an express server to facilitate a connection with google sheets securely

To run this locally:

`cd server`

`pnpm install`

`pnpm dev`

Note: there are no tests for this due to google integration being the majority

### Deploying and other setup

Build FE ready for S3 without dev deps
`pnpm build --production`

Build and zip backend ready for lambda  
`pnpm build --production`
`zip -r backend.zip ./server -x ".*"`

Configure aws credentials with AWS CLI  
`aws configure`

Download necessary dependencies  
`terraform init`

Check plan  
`terraform plan`

Apply changes  
`terraform apply`
